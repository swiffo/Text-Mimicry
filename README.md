# Text-Mimicry

Have you ever wondered what sort of text you could randomly generate using the frequencies 
of letter combinations in Shakespearen plays? If not, please take a moment to wonder as the
rest of the text assumes that you have ...

Wonder no more!

In the following we read 3 Shakespearen plays, counting and storing all N-letter combinations occuring.
We then generate a random text by first choosing an N-letter combination with each combination having 
a probability of being chosen proportional to the number of times in occurred in the plays. We then extend 
this inductively by taking the last N-1 letters of our random text, and choosing the next letter with
a probability proportional to the number of times the N-letter combination occurs in the plays.

## Example: N = 3
